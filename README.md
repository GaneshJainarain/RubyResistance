# Ruby Resistance - Stock Trading AI

Ruby Resistance is a Python-based software designed to analyze key resistance and support levels of stocks. This information is crucial for predicting the future direction of stock prices.

## Why Resistance and Support Levels Matter

Resistance and support levels are vital technical indicators used in stock trading. They help traders and investors make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding stocks. Understanding these levels can provide insights into potential price movements.

## Features

- **Resistance and Support Analysis**: Ruby Resistance uses advanced algorithms to identify and analyze resistance and support levels for selected stocks.

- **Predictive Analytics**: The AI engine leverages historical data to make predictions about the likelihood of a stock going up or down based on resistance and support levels.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: We provide an easy-to-use interface for traders and investors to access and interpret the analysis results.

## Future of the Project

Ruby Resistance is an ongoing project with a roadmap that includes the following:

- **Integration with Brokerage APIs**: We plan to integrate with popular brokerage APIs, allowing users to execute trades directly from the application.

- **Machine Learning Enhancements**: Continual improvement of our AI algorithms for more accurate predictions and better performance.

- **Customizable Alerts**: Users will have the option to set up personalized alerts for specific stocks and price thresholds.

- **Community and Support**: We aim to build an active community of users and contributors to enhance the project and provide support.
